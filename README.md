Caliptra AES RoCC Accelerator
-----------------------------

This wraps up the AES cipher core from the Caliptra Root of Trust project (https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-rtl) into a RoCC accelerator to be used in Rocket Chip based designs.
Currently only AES256 ECB is supported.

For more information on how to use this wrapper, refer to (https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard).
